## SI Lesson Overview
- Give an overview of the architecture of the Web.
- Talk about how Rails or other frameworks fall within the architecture of the web
- Talk about the MVC design pattern and how it falls within the architecture of the web
- The MVC pattern in Rails and thus RoR's folder structure this is a good resource

## MVC and Web Architecture

### Web Architecture
- Go over [Internet/Web App Overview](http://www.slideshare.net/cchamnap/introduction-to-web-architecture)

### Where does Rails fit into web architecture?
- Rails is a framework (server side, CGI scripting)
  - Can be used to create a service or API - app that just returns JSON data
  - Can be used to make consumer web app
  - Can be used to power the data for a smartphone app
  - Alternatives in other languages:
    - Laravel (PHP)
    - Django (Python)
    - .NET (C#)

### What is MVC?
- Rails uses the MVC pattern, Model View Controller ([show image](http://dab1nmslvvntp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/mvc1.png))
  - Way of organizing applications, separates concerns
    - As application grows, organization and standards and ease of unit testing become *huge* concerns
    - Any beginner can make a web app these days, but making a sustainable, scalable product with a team takes practice and years of experience
    - Takes advantage of Object Oriented programming, which helps organize code and create logical pieces in an application
